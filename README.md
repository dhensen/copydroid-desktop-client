# Copydroid desktop client

## Copydroid
I wanted to have copy paste between my phone and computer. Or between two phones, or between two computers, etc. So I made it.

## Code
Sharing this code I once wrote, maybe someone can benefit from it.
I built this desktop client using Qt Creator in 2012. I chose Qt because I wanted it to be cross-platform and I had some C++ experience.
It was used in conjunction with the Copydroid API, written in PHP 5.x, the Copydroid Android app and the copydroid.com website.


## Project history
This was part of a hobby project that consisted of several parts:
- Copydroid backend API written in PHP 5.x
- Copydroid Android App written in Java for Android 2.1 up until Android 4.0 (which was latest at that time)
- Copydroid desktop client, written in C++ (this project)
- Copydroid website, written in PHP 5.x, jQuery

The goal of this project was to see what I could do as a solo developer and it was a big learning moment.
Doing the whole project took 3 months of free time and at the end I had an android app on the Android market, which is know today as the Play Store.
I had a live website, www.copydroid.com, where one could download the desktop client. There was also a web-client on the site so that you could use this on public computers. I pulled the plug on this project when I had no more time to maintain it.
